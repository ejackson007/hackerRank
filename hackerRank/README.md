# HackerRank
## Purpose
More and more, I find myself relying on python for many of my personal projects. While for what I do for myself does not require the benefits that c++ has to offer, I likely will need the computational efficiency of c++. Although I started on c++, I do not use it as frequently and therefore am not as proficient in it. 
## Goal
I hope by solving these hackRank problems that I can stay fresh with my c++ skills, as well as practicing things for more computationally practical things.
